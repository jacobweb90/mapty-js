///////////////////////////// Project Planning ////////////////////////////

// Process
/// Step 1: User Stories
/// Step 2: Features
/// Step 3: FlowChart
/// Step 4: Architecture

// Step 1: User stories
/// The description of application functionality from user perspectives
/// Overview of the overall application
/// So that developer can determine the exact features in order to make the user stories work

/// Formats:

//// Sentence: As a [type of user] I want to perform [certain action] so that I can get [certain benefit] , who, what, why

///// For example:
///// 1. As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minute, so I can keep a log of all my running

///// 2. As a user, I want to log my cycling workouts with location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain, so I can keep a log of all my running

///// 3. As a user, I want to see all my workout at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time.

///// 4. As a user, I want to see my workouts on a map, so that I can easily check where I work out the most

///// 5. As a user, I want to see all my workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so that I can keep using the app over time

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Step 2: Features
/// So that developer can determine the exact features in order to make the user stories work
/// Deciding features based on each user stories above

//// 1.
//// A map where an user can click to add new workout (get location coordinates)
//// Geolocation to display map at current location (more user friendly so users do not to scroll to their location)
//// Form to input distance, time, pace, steps/minute

//// 2.
///// Form to input distance, time, speed, elevation gain

//// 3.
///// Display all workouts in a list

//// 4.
///// Display all workouts on the map

//// 5.
///// store the workout data in the browser using local storage API

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Step 3: Flowchart
/// What we will build, what the program should do
/// Visualise actions of the users and how can program react to the actions, we put into the flowchart

/// best practices:
//// start the flowchart with events like page loads

//// It is common for the flowchart continously changing throughout implementation. We do not need to have a final flowchart in the planning phase.
//// Refer the flowchat png

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Step 4: Architecture
/// How we will build it, how the program / application does the functions
/// How we organise our code, what JavaScript we are going to use
/// Structure and develop application functionality
/// we do not need perfect final archictecture in the planning phase, alot of experiments and play around with the codes to find the best codes.
/// Decide where and how we store the data

// Step 1 to Step 4 are the planning steps
